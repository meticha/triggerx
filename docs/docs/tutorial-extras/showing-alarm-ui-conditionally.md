# ðŸ’Š Showing Alarm UI conditionally

TriggerX gives you full control over **whether** to show the alarm screen based on your Appâ€™s logic, such
as values stored in a Room database, preferences, or feature flags.

You can configure these conditions using the `TriggerX.init()` function inside your `Application` class.

## ðŸ“± 1. Skip Alarm UI When App Is Active

If you donâ€™t want the alarm UI to appear while the App is already in the foreground (e.g. user is using the app), set
the following:

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        TriggerX.init(this) {
            showAlarmActivityWhenAppIsActive = false
        }
    }
} 
```

This is useful when you want to handle the alarm inside the app manually without launching a separate screen.

## ðŸ’¡ 2. Skip Alarm UI When Device Is Active

If you want to avoid interrupting the user when theyâ€™re actively using the device (e.g. screen is on), set this:

```kotlin
class MyApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        TriggerX.init(this) {
            shouldShowAlarmActivityWhenDeviceIsActive = false
        }
    }
}
```
